# Holiday/Cyber Season Outreach Playbook

Purpose: maximize cold outreach conversions during November–December (Black Friday/Cyber Monday, Christmas) with lean, personal tactics.

## 1) Offer & positioning
- Lead offer: a limited “Holiday Readiness Audit” (e.g., 30–45 minutes) delivering 2–3 quick wins + a short written recap. Scarcity: X slots/week until Dec 20.
- Downsell: “2 tailored ideas by email” for those who won’t book a call.
- Outcome framing: “Win/retain revenue during peak season” → faster decision loops, better promos, fewer ops errors.
- Proof points: past improvements (speed to launch, conversion, retention), even if anonymized.

## 2) Ideal targets & triggers
- ICP: owners/ops/marketing leads at SMBs with seasonal spikes (retail, tourism, hospitality, ecom, events).
- Trigger events to personalize: new product drop, hiring push, recent ad spend spike, site changes, stock outs, store opening, promo announcement, CMS migration, funding news.
- Data hygiene: keep small, accurate lists (10–25 per batch); verify emails; log source + trigger.

## 3) Channel mix
- Email first (highest control), LinkedIn as a light follow, then a short call/voice note if appropriate.
- For higher intent: site popup offering the audit; calendar link in the footer and signature.
- Retarget visitors with a downsell banner if they bounce from the booking page.

## 4) Deliverability basics
- Warm the domain (gradual send volume); use a subdomain for outreach (e.g., hello@).
- Plain-text style, short links (no link farms), minimal images; avoid heavy attachments.
- Custom tracking domains; unique snippets per email to avoid duplicates.

## 5) Email sequence (5 touches, 8–12 business days)
- T1 (value-first): “Saw your <trigger>; here are 2 risks and 1 quick win.” Offer the audit; soft CTA to reply.
- T2 (micro-asset): send a 3–5 bullet checklist specific to their situation.
- T3 (social proof/credibility): a tiny case or outcome; re-offer the audit.
- T4 (downsell): offer the “2 tailored ideas by email” if they won’t meet.
- T5 (breakup/season-end): “Should I close your file?” + one-sentence holiday reminder.

## 6) Subject line starters
- “Quick win before Cyber Monday”
- “<Company> checkout risk I noticed”
- “Two fixes for your promo week”
- “Worth a 15-min triage before Black Friday?”
- “Saw your <trigger>; here’s a faster path”

## 7) Email body pattern (keep it 60–120 words)
- Line 1: Personal hook tied to trigger (“Noticed you’re launching X next week / saw your promo on IG”).
- Line 2–3: Two specific observations + one risk or missed upside.
- Line 4: Offer the audit with a clear benefit (“I’ll give you 3 actions to prevent <risk> / add <win> in 7 days”).
- Line 5: CTA: “Worth a quick triage? If not, I can send 2 ideas by email.”
- PS: Optional link to a 45–60s Loom intro or a 3-bullet checklist (no gate).

## 8) LinkedIn follow cadence (light)
- Day after T1: send connection with note referencing the same trigger.
- After T2: comment on a relevant post with a useful tip (no pitch).
- After T3: DM a single checklist bullet + “happy to send the full 5-item list.”

## 9) Calling / voice note (optional but strong)
- Call/voice note on Day 6–8 for high-fit leads: “Saw X, two quick fixes for your promo window—can I send them?”
- Keep to 30–45 seconds; ask permission to email the ideas.

## 10) Objection turns (short)
- “Too busy now” → “I’ll send 2 ideas you can forward to your team—no call needed.”
- “We’re covered” → “Mind if I send one risk check specific to <trigger> so you can sanity-check?”
- “Not interested” → “Understood. Want me to close the loop or send one checklist item you can keep?”

## 11) Seasonal angles
- Cyber week: focus on checkout speed, inventory visibility, promo clarity, abandoned cart rescue.
- December: emphasize last-minute conversions, gift cards, bundles, and service readiness.
- Post-Christmas: returns process, retention, and Q1 pipeline (new-year planning).

## 12) Assets to prepare (1–2 hours)
- 5-point “Promo Readiness” checklist (plain text).
- 45–60s Loom intro: who you are, what you spotted, how the audit works.
- 2–3 micro-cases (even anonymized) with outcome bullets.
- Booking link with 20–30 minute slots; buffer around weekends/holidays.

## 13) Metrics to watch
- Deliverability: bounce <3%, spam complaints near 0.
- Opens are noisy; prioritize replies (% of sent), positive reply rate, booked calls, and show rate.
- Track which triggers/subjects yield replies; double down on winners.

## 14) Daily/weekly cadence
- Daily: 10–25 highly targeted emails; log triggers and replies; send follow-ups from the sequence.
- Weekly: refresh the checklist snippet; rotate 2–3 subject lines; refine the offer copy.
- End of each week: prune non-responders after T5; note which triggers worked.

## 15) Fast personalization templates
- “Noticed you just <trigger>. Two quick risks: <risk1>, <risk2>. I can map 3 fixes in 20 mins. Want the list?”
- “Your <channel> promo for <product> looks strong. One gap I see: <gap>. Can I send 2 fixes, no call needed?”
- “If <event> lands, your bottleneck will be <bottleneck>. I help teams harden that before promo week. Quick triage?”

## 16) Holiday landing tweak (on-site)
- Add a small “Holiday Readiness Audit” CTA block on the homepage/services with a mini-form (name/email/goal).
- Show a downsell bar on exit: “Too busy? I’ll email you 2 fixes—drop your email.”
- Add a thank-you page with a secondary CTA to book a call or ask a question.

## 17) Follow-up content ideas (for replies)
- Short teardown (3–5 bullets) of their current flow with one screenshot.
- A/B test suggestion: subject/promo layout/CTA; include expected lift and low effort.
- A 2-step “do this today” action list tied to their stack (e.g., Shopify/WP/GA).

## 18) Guardrails
- Keep tone personal and concise; avoid hype language that trips filters.
- No attachments; use plain text, one link max in first email.
- Respect opt-outs immediately; avoid sending after Dec 23 unless high-fit.

## 19) If volume increases
- Use a light CRM/airtable sheet to track sequence state.
- Stagger send times; rotate between 2–3 subject/body variants to spread risk.
- Consider a dedicated outreach domain to protect the main domain.

## 20) Quick start (today)
- Draft the 5-point checklist, the 60s Loom, and the T1 email template.
- Build a 10–25 lead list with triggers; send T1; schedule T2/T3 now.
- Add a homepage CTA bar + Netlify mini-form for the audit; enable notifications.

## 21) Simple landing variants to test (from the “three layouts” idea)
- Layout A: headline + subheadline + content + form. Fewest distractions; best for “you asked for X, here it is.”
- Layout B: same as A with a supportive image. Use one clear visual (hero/person/product) to anchor attention.
- Layout C: headline + subheadline + image + three bullets + form. Bullets = value/credibility/what they get.
- Rule: fewer elements = faster tests and higher raw conversion; add steps/bullets only if you need to qualify.
- How to use: pick one layout, A/B one element at a time (headline, CTA text, image). If leads are noisy, add a single qualifier question; if volume is low, remove steps.
