# 25 Sales Tricks to Apply on the Site (from sales.md)

1) Lead with a rational + emotional headline: what they get and why it matters now.
2) Subheadline removes doubt: who it’s for/not for, in one line.
3) Show 2–3 proof points (metrics, outcomes) near the hero CTA to transfer belief.
4) Add a high anchor (“full advisory value $X”) before your actual offer to reframe price.
5) State a clear, limited offer (e.g., X slots/week) to create real scarcity.
6) Publish a simple guarantee or “I’ll fix it” promise to lower perceived risk.
7) Add an objection-killer FAQ block where you pre-answer money/time/fit concerns.
8) Include a “who I don’t help” line to increase trust and filter bad fits.
9) Use a 3-step “how it works” strip (book → audit → action plan) to make the next move obvious.
10) Place the main CTA above the fold and repeat it after each major proof block.
11) Add a downsell CTA (“Just send me your top 2 questions”) for visitors who won’t book.
12) Add a short Loom (45–60s) introducing yourself + what happens on the call (transference of belief).
13) Put testimonials/case blurbs right beside the CTA, not buried below.
14) Add mini-case snapshots with before/after and one quote to make proof tangible.
15) Show “what happens after you click” (confirmation → email → time window) to reduce friction.
16) Use plain-text style in forms and confirmations; avoid hypey language that trips spam filters.
17) Ask one qualifier in the form (“Biggest obstacle?”) to start the conversation with their words.
18) Add a “reply to this email” prompt in the form confirmation for fast engagement.
19) Make the offer time-bound for the season (e.g., “Holiday Readiness Audit until Dec 20”).
20) Add a light price anchor + installment/option if relevant; show total value first.
21) Surface your convictions: why this offer works and why now (rational logic after emotion).
22) Record a 30–60s audio/voice note option for people who prefer not to book a call.
23) Add a “Recordings reviewed” line: mention you study calls/emails to improve outcomes (signals rigor).
24) Keep landing pages simple: headline, subheadline, proof, CTA; test image vs. image+3 bullets.
25) Track replies, not just clicks: wire the CTA form to send an email notification and log source page.
